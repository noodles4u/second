#### An aspiring web dev

> I'm a neophyte coder who loves good food, linking interesting ideas together who might not have a direct link & I mostly like a good-looking book. I aspire to create some over the top but also very simple website with a pleasant user experience, and most of all be creative in the visual aspect.

#### 1. (Un)Suprprising Skills
- I spend way too much time researching random (interesting) topics
- I'm a graphic designer but I can't draw
- I like to bike without hands but that has gotten me in an accident as a kid

#### 2. Another list with things I like
- I really really like lists, so markdown is amazing for that
    - You can even make sublists isn't that amazing
        - one more item
            - and another
    
- I love some (extra) spicy food
- I like to drink a lot of coffee but never know my limit.
    - The types of coffee I like:
        1. A normal black coffee
        2. A cappucino
        3. An **Irish** coffee
        4. A *lil* espresso
        5. 

#### 3. Objectives

>I'm tempted to make another list but I'll restrain myself. I'll instead use a table and put them in no particular order
